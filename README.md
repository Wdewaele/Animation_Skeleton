 __Software used__
Visual Studio 2017 

__Libraries used__
- WhiteBoxEngine (3D Engine made by a professor at ISART Digital: https://github.com/Trizek/WhiteBoxEngine)
- GLEW to manipulate the OpenGL over the WhiteBoxEngine (Which uses SDL as window and rendering context)
- AltMath (Mathematic library made in collaboration with my classmates)

__WARNING__

The application is unstable and sometimes the model won't show up. All you have to do is to close the application and re-open it again. This error is due to resources parsing and comes from the version of WhiteBoxEngine I used.
